# wainaina-peter-Portfolio
This was a very fun project to do. I learnt about tailwindCSS and decided to give it a rty and consiquently ended up loving it. I employed tailwind CSS and Vite rather than the conventional create-react-app in this simple Portfolio and I'm happy that it turned out great. I developed this front end portfolio using ReactJS.
